# Contributing to glassnode-api

Thanks for helping improve the TypeScript client for the Glassnode API. This guide walks you
through opening a pull request (PR).

**Every merge to `main` publishes a new version to npm automatically**
(`.github/workflows/publish.yml`), so nothing lands on `main` except through a reviewed PR.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** for development (see `.nvmrc`; the test runner, Vitest, needs Node >= 22.12).
  Consumers of the published package only need Node.js >= 18.
- **pnpm** (the version is pinned in `package.json` `packageManager`; `corepack enable` picks it
  up).

## Opening a pull request, step by step

### 1. Fork or branch

Fork the repository (or, with write access, create a branch) and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/glassnode-api-ts-client.git
cd glassnode-api-ts-client
git checkout -b my-change
pnpm install
pnpm exec husky   # install the pre-commit hook
```

The repo's `.npmrc` disables install scripts, so `pnpm install` does not set up the Husky
pre-commit hook on its own; `pnpm exec husky` does. The hook runs the tests, ESLint + Prettier on
staged files and the build.

### 2. Make the change

Project layout:

- `src/index.ts` - main entry (`glassnode-api`): the `GlassnodeAPI` client, errors and types
- `src/x402.ts` - the `glassnode-api/x402` subpath entry (paid calls via x402)
- `src/types/` - Zod schemas and the types inferred from them
- `test/` - Vitest tests, including the contract tests in `test/contract.spec.ts`
- `examples/` - runnable usage examples (their own `package.json`)
- `scripts/` - the Node 18 smoke test and the contract fixture recorder
- `typecheck/x402-node16/` - a consumer type-check fixture

Add or update tests for what you change. The public API is what `src/index.ts` and `src/x402.ts`
export; if you change it, update `README.md` to match and give every new export a doc comment.
The shipped code must keep running on Node.js 18 and in browsers: no `node:` built-ins and no APIs
newer than Node 18 in `src/`.

### 3. Bump the version and add a changelog entry

Every change bumps `version` in `package.json` and adds an entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`
describing it. Follow [semver](https://semver.org/):

- **Major**: breaking changes (removed or renamed exports, changed method signatures, a higher
  minimum Node.js version).
- **Minor**: new features, methods or config options that are backward compatible.
- **Patch**: bug fixes, docs and internal refactors with no API change.

The publish workflow adds its own patch bump on top when it releases, so the published version can
be one patch higher than the one in your PR.

### 4. Run the full local check list

CI runs these on every PR; run them locally first:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm test
pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit
pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.examples.json
pnpm run build
pnpm run build:browser
npx prettier --check .
pnpm run docs
pnpm dlx publint
pnpm dlx @arethetypeswrong/cli --pack .
```

`pnpm run test:coverage` enforces the coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`, and
`pnpm run format` fixes formatting. `pnpm run docs` fails on any TypeDoc warning, such as a broken
`{@link}`.

### 5. Open the PR against `main`

A good PR description says:

- **What** changed.
- **Why**: the problem it solves or the issue it closes.
- **How it was verified**: the checks you ran and any manual testing.
- **User-facing impact**: behaviour changes for consumers, and any breaking change called out
  explicitly.

### 6. CI, review and merge

CI must pass, and a maintainer reviews the PR. Once it is approved, a maintainer merges it, and
the merge publishes the new version to npm.

## Contract fixtures

`test/fixtures/contract/` holds real API responses recorded by `scripts/record-fixtures.mjs`.
Never hand-edit them; re-record them. That needs an API key, so it is only done to refresh the
fixtures. See [Recording contract fixtures](./README.md#recording-contract-fixtures) in the README.

## Security

- Report vulnerabilities privately, through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this
  repository (the **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**). Never open a public issue for
  them.
- Never commit API keys or other secrets, including in fixtures, examples, `.env` files or test
  output.
