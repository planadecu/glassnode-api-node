 * The API key never appears in the `message` or any other string property (`detail`,

 * texts, transport and x402 errors) is masked first — `api_key=<value>` always, raw copies of the

 * object, which may quote the request URL or the key, so do not log `.cause` where the key must
 * not appear.

 *
 * - `false` — nothing was paid: the payment layer (`@x402/fetch`) failed before a paid request was
 *   sent, e.g. every payment requirement the server offered was above `maxPaymentPerCall` (or
 *   x402's own spend controls), the signer failed, or the server's `402` carried no usable payment
 *   requirements. The same request would fail the same way.
 * - `true` — a request carrying a signed payment was sent, and the call then failed: either the
 *   paid request failed in transit (connection reset, or the `timeout` abort), or it was answered
 *   with a non-2xx HTTP status other than `402` (e.g. a gateway `502`/`504`, a `429`, a `400`).
 *   The server (or the origin behind a proxy) may already have received the payment and settled
 *   it on-chain, so a retry would sign a **new** payment and could charge twice. Check the
 *   payer's on-chain transfers before retrying. For a transport failure the original error is on
 *   `.cause` and {@link GlassnodePaymentError.timedOut} says whether it was the per-request
 *   `timeout`; for an HTTP failure {@link GlassnodePaymentError.status} is set and `.cause` is the
 *   {@link GlassnodeApiError} (with `status`, `statusText`, `detail`) the response amounts to.
 *
 * The original error is on `.cause`. A transport failure or `429`/`5xx` of the *unpaid* request
 * (before any payment was signed) stays a retryable {@link GlassnodeNetworkError} /
 * {@link GlassnodeApiError}; a `402` answer to the paid request (the server refused the payment,
 * e.g. insufficient USDC) stays a {@link GlassnodeApiError} with `status` 402, which is never
 * retried either.
