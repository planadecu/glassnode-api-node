# Changelog

## 0.29.1

- Release: the publish workflow now releases the `version` in `package.json` as is. It no longer
  bumps the patch version or commits and pushes "Bump version [skip ci]" to `main`, which a
  protected `main` would reject. If that version is already on npm (a merge without a bump, or a
  re-run), it skips the publish with a notice in the job summary; only an npm 404 counts as "not
  published", and any other registry or network error fails the job.
- Release: the workflow runs the full CI check list first (`ci.yml`, now also a reusable
  workflow), and the publish job runs in the `npm` GitHub environment, so it waits for a
  maintainer's approval. After publishing it pushes a `v<version>` tag and creates a GitHub
  Release from the version's `CHANGELOG.md` section. Permissions are per job; only the publish job
  can write (`id-token` for npm Trusted Publishing, `contents` for the tag and Release), and
  `packages: write` is gone. Publishes are serialized and never cancelled.
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` describe the new release flow. No change to the
  published package.

## 0.29.0

- License: relicensed from MIT to the Apache License 2.0 from this version on. Earlier published
  versions remain under the MIT License. `LICENSE` now holds the Apache-2.0 text with copyright
  Jordi Planadecursach and Glassnode GmbH, and `package.json` `license` is `Apache-2.0`.
- Added: a `NOTICE` file with the copyright and attribution (the project was originally created by
  Jordi Planadecursach). It ships in the npm package, and Apache-2.0 §4(d) requires redistributors
  to keep it. Glassnode GmbH is listed under `contributors` in `package.json`.
- Moved: the repository is now
  [glassnode/glassnode-api-ts-client](https://github.com/glassnode/glassnode-api-ts-client)
  (formerly `planadecu/glassnode-api-node`), and the API reference is at
  https://glassnode.github.io/glassnode-api-ts-client/. The `repository`, `bugs` and `homepage`
  links in `package.json`, the README, the TypeDoc GitHub link and the workflow comments point at
  the new home. The npm package name, `glassnode-api`, is unchanged.
- Added: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a step-by-step guide to opening a pull request (local checks, version
  and changelog rules, how releases work), plus security reporting and the licensing of
  contributions. No code change.

## 0.28.4

- Fixed: `npm ci` in `examples/` failed with "package.json and package-lock.json are not in sync":
  `examples/package-lock.json` predated the x402 dependencies in `examples/package.json`. The
  lockfile is regenerated with the declared ranges unchanged. Added: `@x402/fetch`, `@x402/evm`
  and `@x402/core` 2.26.0, `viem` 2.56.7 and their dependencies (`ox` 0.14.45, `abitype` 1.2.3,
  `@noble/curves` 1.9.1, `@noble/hashes` 1.8.0, `@noble/ciphers` 1.3.0, `@scure/base` 1.2.6,
  `@scure/bip32` 1.7.0, `@scure/bip39` 1.6.0, `@adraffy/ens-normalize` 1.11.1, `isows` 1.0.7,
  `ws` 8.21.0, `eventemitter3` 5.0.1, `zod` 3.25.76). Every new version was published at least
  7 days before resolution. Existing entries (`dotenv`, `ts-node` and its dependencies) keep their
  versions and now also record their registry `resolved` URL and `integrity` hash, which they
  lacked.
- Added: `examples/.npmrc` with `ignore-scripts=true`. npm treats `examples/` as its own project
  and does not read the root `.npmrc`, so installs there ran lifecycle scripts.
- CI: the examples step now runs `npm ci` in `examples/`, so a stale lockfile fails the build, and
  imports `../src` with the locally installed `ts-node` instead of `pnpm dlx`. No change to the
  published package.

## 0.28.2

- Fixed: the example scripts run again with `npx ts-node ex.<name>.ts` from `examples/`. They
  failed with `Cannot find module './glassnode-api.js'` because `src/` imports its siblings with
  `.js` specifiers, which ts-node's CommonJS `require` does not map to the `.ts` sources. A new
  `examples/tsconfig.json` (extending `tsconfig.examples.json`) turns on ts-node's
  `experimentalResolver`, which does. CI now imports `../src` through ts-node from `examples/`
  (offline) to catch a regression. No change to the published package.

## 0.28.1

- Docs: the 0.26.0 changelog entry now notes its compile-time change for code that reads the
  `fetch` option: `GlassnodeConfig['fetch']` takes a string, so calling it with a `URL` or
  `Request` no longer type-checks.
- Docs: the `default_network` comment on asset metadata no longer ties the field to tokens deployed
  on several blockchains, which the recorded data does not bear out. It now describes the observed
  values (`"eth"`, `"sol"`, `"ton"`, or `""` for native assets and some tokens). No code change.

## 0.28.0

- Added: asset metadata entries (`AssetMetadataSchema` / `AssetMetadata`) now keep four fields the
  API returns that the schema used to strip: `categories` (`string[]`, e.g.
  `["exchanges", "on-chain", "spot"]`), `logo_url` (`string`), `semantic_tags` (`string[]`, may be
  empty) and `default_network` (`string`, e.g. `"eth"`; `""` for native assets such as BTC).
- Added: metric metadata (`MetricMetadataSchema` / `MetricMetadata`) now keeps
  `parameters_defaults`, the default value of each defaulted parameter as a record of string arrays
  (e.g. `{ e: ['aggregated'] }`). The API only sends it for some metrics.
- All five fields are optional, following the lenient-response policy (see 0.12.0): a response
  without them still validates and the field is `undefined`. A present field of the wrong type
  (e.g. `categories: "spot"`) fails validation, like any other typed field.
- Docs: the `asset_type` comment now gives the real values, `"BLOCKCHAIN"` and `"TOKEN"` (it said
  `"coin"` / `"token"`). It stays a plain `string`, not an enum, so a new type does not fail
  validation.
- Tests: the contract tests assert the new fields on the recorded responses and no longer expect
  any stripped fields; unit tests cover the fields absent, empty and mistyped. The spec and the
  README list the literals a re-recording may require updating.

## 0.27.1

- Tests: contract tests (`test/contract.spec.ts`) against 10 real API responses recorded by
  `scripts/record-fixtures.mjs` and committed under `test/fixtures/contract/`: asset metadata, the
  metric list, metric metadata and stats (with and without `a`), a `{ t, v }` and a `{ t, o }`
  series, and a bulk response. Each is served through a mocked `fetch` to its client method. The
  tests check that it validates, returns the recorded values (timestamps as documented), and that
  the client builds the recorded request URL. They also pin the fields the schemas do not model
  yet: `categories`, `logo_url`, `semantic_tags` and `default_network` on assets, and
  `parameters_defaults` on metric metadata. All 10 responses pass the current schemas. No change to
  the published package.

## 0.27.0

### Security

- With `apiKeyLocation: 'header'`, the client no longer follows redirects: it sends
  `redirect: 'manual'` with the `X-Api-Key` header, because `fetch`'s default `redirect: 'follow'`
  resends custom headers to whatever origin a `3xx` names (including an `https` → `http`
  downgrade). A `3xx` now surfaces as a non-retried `GlassnodeApiError` with that status whose
  message says the redirect was not followed (it never contains the key or the `Location`).
- The fetch from `createX402Fetch()` never follows redirects either (`redirect: 'manual'`; a
  caller's `'error'` is kept), so a signed `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` / `X-PAYMENT` header is never sent to
  a redirect target, and a redirect target can no longer price (and collect) the payment. A `3xx` to
  the unpaid request is a `GlassnodeApiError` (nothing signed); a `3xx` to the paid request stays a
  `GlassnodePaymentError` with `paymentMayHaveSettled: true`, never retried.
- The default `apiKeyLocation: 'query'` path is unchanged: a custom `fetch` is still called as
  `fetch(url)`, and redirects are followed as before.

### Behaviour change

- Header mode: a custom `fetch` now receives `redirect: 'manual'` in `init`, and a redirecting proxy
  in front of the API now fails instead of being followed — point `apiUrl` at the final URL.
  Minor bump to flag this.

## 0.26.3

- Security (tooling): `scripts/record-fixtures.mjs` no longer follows redirects. It used fetch's
  default `redirect: 'follow'`, and Node's fetch keeps custom headers across origins, so a 3xx from
  the target resent the `X-Api-Key` header to the redirect host, even over plain http. That broke
  the script's guarantee that the key is never sent unencrypted to a remote host (only the initial
  URL was checked). Requests now use `redirect: 'manual'`, and any 3xx aborts the run with nothing
  written. The error gives the status and the target's origin and path, with the key masked.
- Tooling: the fixture size policy now covers the object-shaped responses the script records.
  An object over 2 MB (e.g. a bulk `{ data: [...] }` response) keeps the first 200 entries of each
  top-level array property, where before it was written in full. A response that has no array to
  trim, or is still over 2 MB after trimming, aborts the run. Not published; no change to the
  package.

## 0.26.2

- Added a generated API reference built with TypeDoc (`pnpm run docs`, output in the untracked
  `api-docs/`), covering both entry points (`glassnode-api` and `glassnode-api/x402`), with
  Zod-derived types expanded into readable object types via `typedoc-plugin-zod`. New
  devDependencies: `typedoc`, `typedoc-plugin-zod` (not shipped to consumers).
- The docs build treats warnings as errors (broken `{@link}`s, referenced-but-unexported types, bad
  README paths) and runs in CI on every pull request.
- New `docs.yml` workflow deploys the API reference to GitHub Pages
  (https://planadecu.github.io/glassnode-api-node/) on every push to `main`; the README links to it.
  Requires the repository's Pages source to be set to "GitHub Actions".
- Docs: documented `GlassnodeApiError.status` and `GlassnodeApiError.statusText`, and added module
  comments naming the two entry points after their import specifiers. No runtime change.

## 0.26.1

- Tooling: new `scripts/record-fixtures.mjs` records real Glassnode API responses (asset metadata,
  metric list, metric metadata and stats with and without `a`, a `{t, v}` series, a `{t, o}` series
  and a bulk response) into `test/fixtures/contract/` with a `manifest.json`, for upcoming contract
  tests of the response schemas. The key is read only from `GLASSNODE_API_KEY` and sent only as the
  `X-Api-Key` header; the run aborts without writing anything on any HTTP error or if the key
  appears in the output. Responses over 2 MB are trimmed to a representative subset. Documented in
  the README "Development" section; the recorded fixtures are excluded from Prettier. Not
  published; no change to the package.

## 0.26.0

- Types: the `fetch` config option is now typed as the new exported `GlassnodeFetch`
  (`(input: string, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>`) — the call the client actually makes
  (`fetch(url)` / `fetch(url, init)` with a string URL) — instead of `typeof fetch`. This relaxes
  0.25.0's compile-time change: string-only custom fetches and mocks
  (`async (url: string, init?: RequestInit) => …`) type-check again, without a cast. Everything
  accepted before still is (`globalThis.fetch`, `vi.fn()`, `vi.fn<typeof fetch>()`, the fetch from
  `createX402Fetch()`, a `(input: RequestInfo | URL, init?) => Promise<Response>` fetch). An inline
  `fetch: async (input, init) => …` now gets `input: string`. A fetch that does not resolve to a
  `Response` is still rejected. No runtime change: validation and function identity are unchanged.
- Deprecated: `FetchFn`. It still means `typeof fetch` (and a `FetchFn` value is still accepted as
  the option), but it is no longer the option's type; use `GlassnodeFetch`.
- **Compile-time change when reading the option (noted retroactively in 0.28.1):** passing a fetch
  is unaffected, but `GlassnodeConfig['fetch']` (or a config's `.fetch`) is now a function taking a
  string, so calling it with a `URL` or `Request` no longer type-checks
  (`Argument of type 'URL' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'`). Fix: call it with a
  string URL (e.g. `url.toString()`), or type your own variable as `typeof fetch`.

## 0.25.1

- Docs: `examples/.env.example` now lists every example that uses `GLASSNODE_API_KEY` (adds
  `ex.metric-stats.ts`) with the scripts' actual `ex.*` file names. The README "Examples" section
  adds the root `pnpm install` step (the examples import the client from `../src`, which needs
  `zod`) and mentions the `X402_*` variables, matching `examples/README.md`. No code change.

## 0.25.0

- Types: `GlassnodeConfig['logger']` is now `Logger` (`(message: string, ...args: unknown[]) => void`)
  and `GlassnodeConfig['fetch']` is `FetchFn` (`typeof fetch`), as documented, instead of Zod's
  generic function type (`(...args: never[]) => unknown`), which accepted any function. Inline
  callbacks now get contextual types (`logger: (message, ...args) => …` gives `message: string`;
  `fetch: async (input, init) => …` gives the `fetch` parameter types), and the client no longer
  casts either option internally.
- **Compile-time change for callers (0.x minor):** a value that is not assignable to `typeof fetch`
  or `Logger` no longer type-checks. Most notably, a custom fetch declared with a narrower input
  (`async (url: string, init?: RequestInit) => …`) must declare its first parameter as
  `Parameters<typeof fetch>[0]` (or `unknown`), or be cast with `as typeof fetch`; the same applies
  to a fetch with its own `Request`/`Response` types (e.g. `node-fetch`, or `undici`'s `fetch`
  imported directly in a project whose `lib` includes `DOM`). `globalThis.fetch`, `vi.fn()` mocks,
  the fetch from `createX402Fetch()` and `console.log`-style loggers are unaffected.
- Changed: `logger` and `fetch` are validated with `typeof value === 'function'` (like `hooks`)
  and kept as given. Before, `z.function()` replaced each with a Zod wrapper that forwarded its
  arguments, `this` and return value unchanged, so calls behaved the same but the client held a
  different function (e.g. its `length` was `0`). A non-function is still a `GlassnodeConfigError`;
  its message now reads `logger: must be a function` instead of Zod's generic
  `Invalid input: expected function, received string`.

## 0.24.3

- Docs: `examples/README.md` now documents `ex.bulk.market-cap.ts`; lists dependencies exactly as in
  `examples/package.json` (`zod` resolves from the root install, not the examples); adds the root
  `pnpm install` and `cp .env.example .env` setup steps; describes `ex.metric.dump.ts` accurately
  (first 10 metrics); and lists the optional `X402_*` overrides for the x402 example. No code change.

## 0.24.2

- Fixed: a `logger` that throws (or returns a rejected promise) can no longer change a call.
  Before, a throw from the `'API call:'` line made the call reject with that raw error — not a
  `GlassnodeError`, and without firing `onError` — even when the request would have succeeded, and
  a throw from the `'Retry …'` line aborted the retries; a logger returning a rejected promise
  caused an unhandled rejection (also when it was reporting a hook failure). Every logger call now
  goes through one guard: the logger is still called synchronously with the same arguments and is
  never awaited, and its own failure is swallowed silently (it cannot be reported to the logger
  that just failed, and hooks are for the call's own events). Results, retries, retry waits, error
  classes and hook events are the same as with a working logger.
- Docs: README (config table, Observability) and the `Logger` JSDoc note that logger failures are
  ignored.

## 0.24.1

- Docs: accuracy pass over the README against the code. Retries: `maxRetries` also retries
  transport failures (network errors, per-attempt timeouts), not only `429`/`5xx`, and a
  `Retry-After` is honoured on any retried `429`/`5xx` (capped at `maxRetryDelay`, not jittered),
  not only on a `429`. Configuration: the `apiUrl` default with `x402`, the `2147483647` ms cap on
  `timeout`/`retryDelay`/`maxRetryDelay`, and that `fetch` is required with `x402`. Error table:
  the full `GlassnodeInputError.argument` list (`params`, `options`, `options.schema`, `value`) and
  the missing subclasses in the feature list. x402: `createX402Fetch`'s `account` is an
  `X402SignerAccount` (not viem's `LocalAccount` type), and the `usdcDecimalToAtomic` /
  `createMaxAmountPolicy` helpers are listed. Also the exact `logger` call shape, when a custom
  `fetch` is called with the URL alone, the Node.js >= 18 requirement, the examples install step
  and the type-check commands under Development.
- Docs: "Timestamps" now says the `getMetricStats` lag percentiles (`p50`…`p99`, `unit`
  `"seconds"`) are durations, not timestamps, and must not be passed to `new Date(p * 1000)`
  (also in the `LagPercentilesSchema` and module JSDoc).
- Docs: hook events must be treated as read-only — `event.error` is the live error object the
  caller receives, so a hook that mutates it changes the caller's error (README and
  `GlassnodeHooks` JSDoc).
- Docs: CHANGELOG 0.21.3 now also lists the second symptom of that bug (a config `timeout` between
  2^31 and 2^32 − 1 ms silently made every call time out after ~1 ms).
- Docs: CLAUDE.md's API Client section lists every config option with its default, plus the
  project layout, check commands, CI jobs and browser bundle details. No code or type change.

## 0.24.0

- Added: **repeated query parameters.** An array param value is sent as the parameter repeated
  once per element, in the given order — `{ a: ['BTC', 'ETH'] }` → `a=BTC&a=ETH` — which is how
  Glassnode takes several values for one parameter (e.g. the asset/exchange/network whitelists of
  the bulk endpoints). Works in `callMetric`, `callBulkMetric`, `getMetricMetadata` and
  `getMetricStats`, with the API key in the query or the `X-Api-Key` header, and through x402.
  Each element is converted with the single-value rules (numbers, booleans, `Date` → unix
  seconds).
- Rejected with `GlassnodeInputError` (`argument` `params.<name>`, message naming `<name>[index]`)
  before any request: an empty array (omitting the param would silently widen the request to the
  server default, e.g. every asset), `undefined`/`null`/hole, nested-array or object elements,
  elements that fail the single-value rules (e.g. `NaN`), and an array for the single-valued `s`,
  `u`, `i`, `c` or `f` ("takes a single value"). Arrays for the reserved `api_key` and `path` stay
  rejected as before.
- Types: `MetricParams.a` and `.e` are `string | readonly string[]`, and the index signature
  accepts `MetricParamValue | readonly MetricParamValue[]`; `s`, `u`, `i`, `c` and `f` stay
  single-valued.
- Docs: corrected the 0.18.0 changelog entry, which told callers to replace an array with a
  comma-joined string — `a=BTC,ETH` (sent as `a=BTC%2CETH`) is not the same as two values. The
  README "Query parameters" section now documents arrays with a repeated-param example.
- **Observable for callers:** URLs for non-array params are byte-identical. An array value that
  used to throw `GlassnodeInputError` is now sent as a repeated param (for `s`/`u`/`i`/`c` it still
  throws, with a new message). Type-level: code that _reads_ `a`, `e` or an index-signature
  property back out of a `MetricParams` value now sees the wider union and may need a narrowing.
  Minor bump: new feature and widened parameter types.

## 0.23.1

- Tooling: add a `.prettierignore` that excludes the generated lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`,
  `examples/package-lock.json`), so `pnpm run format` (and the `version` lifecycle script) no longer
  reformats the pnpm lockfile. Prettier still honors `.gitignore`, and `prettier --check .` now
  passes on the whole repo. No package change.

## 0.23.0

- Added: structured observability hooks — the `hooks` config option,
  `{ onRequest, onResponse, onRetry, onError }` (all optional). Each hook gets one event with a
  per-call `callId` (shared by every attempt of a call), `method`, `endpoint`, the redacted `url`,
  the 1-based `attempt` and `maxAttempts`; `onResponse` adds `status`, `ok` and the attempt's
  `durationMs`; `onRetry` adds `reason` (`'status'` / `'network'` / `'timeout'`), `status`, the
  `error`, `delayMs` and `durationMs`; `onError` fires once per failed call (including a caller
  abort and a response validation error) with the `GlassnodeError` the call rejects with, `status`,
  the last attempt's `durationMs` and the call's `elapsedMs`. Invalid arguments
  (`GlassnodeInputError`) fire no hooks.
- Hooks run synchronously and are never awaited; a hook that throws or rejects is swallowed
  (reported to the `logger` as `Hook <name> failed:`) and never changes the call's result or
  retries. Payloads never carry the API key: the URL is masked and no headers (so no `X-Api-Key`
  or x402 payment headers) are exposed. The `hooks` option is validated at construction (unknown
  hook names and non-functions throw `GlassnodeConfigError`). New exported types:
  `GlassnodeHooks`, `GlassnodeHookEventBase`, `GlassnodeRequestEvent`, `GlassnodeResponseEvent`,
  `GlassnodeRetryEvent`, `GlassnodeRetryReason`, `GlassnodeErrorEvent`. The `logger` output is
  unchanged.

## 0.22.3

- Tooling: `pnpm run lint` now honors `.gitignore`. The ESLint flat config imports its patterns via
  `includeIgnoreFile` (built into ESLint 10, no new dependency), so `eslint .` no longer lints
  gitignored trees such as `.claude/` (including local git worktrees, which are full repository
  copies) or `coverage/`. No package change.

## 0.22.2

- Tests: cover x402 payment detection on `init.headers` (plain object, `Headers`, array of tuples)
  and with header-name casing variations, on cross-realm (`node:vm`) `Headers`/`Request` objects,
  and for concurrent calls on one wrapped fetch (a paid call failing in transit does not change how
  another call's unpaid probe failure is classified).
- Tests: cover a 3xx answer to the paid request (`redirect: 'manual'`) and `maxRetries: 0` with a
  non-2xx paid response — both are `GlassnodePaymentError` with `paymentMayHaveSettled: true`.
- Tests: tripwires that fail if `@x402/fetch` / `@x402/core` emits a payment header that
  `PAYMENT_HEADERS` does not recognise; the constant is documented as tracking
  `encodePaymentSignatureHeader`. No library behavior change.

## 0.22.1

- Fixed: a non-JSON error body (e.g. an HTML page from a proxy) is now redacted before it is cut to
  300 characters for `GlassnodeApiError.detail` and the paid-request `GlassnodePaymentError`. Before,
  the body was cut first, so an API key echoed raw (not as `api_key=…`) across the 300-character
  edge lost its tail, no longer matched the key, and its leading characters reached the error
  message and `detail` unmasked. A hostile proxy could pad the body to leak almost the whole key.
  Because masking shortens the text, the 300 characters can now include text that followed a
  masked key. JSON `message`/`error` values are unchanged (they were never cut).

## 0.22.0

- Added: opt-in response validation for `callMetric`. Pass a Zod schema as `options.schema` —
  `callMetric(path, params, { schema })` — and the body is validated and typed as the schema's
  output (`z.output<S>`, so transforms apply). A mismatch rejects with a
  `GlassnodeValidationError` whose `endpoint` is the metric's API path, like every other method.
  A `schema` that is not a Zod schema rejects with a `GlassnodeInputError` (`argument`
  `options.schema`) before any request. `schema` combines with `signal` and `timeout`.
- Added: exported schemas and types for the two common metric shapes —
  `TimeSeriesPointSchema` / `TimeSeriesResponseSchema` (`{ t: number; v: number | null }[]`) and
  `TimeSeriesObjectPointSchema` / `TimeSeriesObjectResponseSchema`
  (`{ t: number; o: Record<string, number | null> }[]`, e.g. `/market/price_usd_ohlc`) — plus the
  `CallMetricOptions<S>` type. They are lenient to additive server changes: extra fields on a point
  are stripped, `o` accepts any keys, and a `null` value does not fail the series.
- Not observable for existing callers: without `schema`, `callMetric<T>` still returns the parsed
  body unvalidated, cast to `T`, with the same typing and runtime behavior. `schema` is a
  `callMetric`-only option; other methods' `options` type does not accept it.

## 0.21.3

- Fixed: the config options `timeout`, `retryDelay` and `maxRetryDelay` are now capped at
  2147483647 ms (2^31 − 1, the largest timer delay), the same as the per-call `timeout`. A larger
  value now throws a `GlassnodeConfigError` when the client is constructed. Before, an oversized
  `timeout` failed in one of two ways: from 2^32 ms up it made every call throw a raw `RangeError`
  from `AbortSignal.timeout()`, while a value between 2^31 and 2^32 − 1 ms did not throw at all but
  overflowed the timer, so every call silently timed out after about 1 ms (a retryable
  `GlassnodeNetworkError` with `timedOut: true`). An oversized `maxRetryDelay` let a long
  `Retry-After` overflow the retry timer, so the client retried after about 1 ms instead of
  waiting. (The second `timeout` symptom was added to this entry in 0.24.1.)

## 0.21.2

- **Security:** the API key no longer leaks into error messages. Before, a `GlassnodeApiError`
  put the server's error body into `message` and `detail` unredacted, so a server or proxy that
  echoed the request URL (`…?api_key=<key>`) or the key itself put the key into errors that
  callers routinely log. Now every text from outside the library that goes into an error — error
  bodies and status texts, transport errors, schema-issue summaries (whose paths carry response
  keys), and x402 payment-layer, signer, paid-transport and paid-HTTP errors — goes through one
  shared redaction (`src/redact.ts`): `api_key=<value>` becomes `api_key=***` (now also a bare
  `api_key=` not preceded by `?`/`&`), and every raw, percent-encoded or form-encoded copy of the
  key becomes `***`.
- Raw copies are only masked for keys of at least 8 characters: the config accepts any non-empty
  key, and masking e.g. a 3-character key everywhere would blank out unrelated words, numbers and
  status codes. Real Glassnode keys are far longer. The `api_key=` form is always masked.
- `createX402Fetch()` is built separately from the client and never sees its config, so it reads
  the key from each request it is given (the `api_key` query value and/or the `X-Api-Key` header)
  and masks that key in its errors, including the `GlassnodeApiError` on `.cause` of a paid HTTP
  failure (whose `statusText` is now redacted too).
- `.cause` is deliberately **not** redacted: it keeps the original object (fetch error,
  `ZodError`, x402 error). The README and the `GlassnodeError` JSDoc now say not to log `.cause`
  where the key must not appear.
- **Observable for callers:** error `message`, `detail` and `statusText` show `***` where they
  used to contain the configured key; nothing changes for errors that never contained it. Patch
  bump: a bug fix with no API change.

## 0.21.1

- Docs: the README's Browser section now says that, as of September 2026, Glassnode's API only
  allows cross-origin requests from `*.glassnode.com`, so the browser bundles cannot call
  `api.glassnode.com` directly from other origins. It recommends a server-side proxy that injects
  the API key (via `apiUrl`) and never shipping a key to the browser. The intro and "Universal"
  feature claims are qualified to match. No code change.

## 0.21.0

- **New:** per-call options on every method, as a new optional **last** argument:
  `getAssetMetadata(options?)`, `getMetricList(options?)`, and `getMetricMetadata`,
  `getMetricStats`, `callMetric`, `callBulkMetric` as `(path, params?, options?)`. `options` is the
  new exported `CallOptions` type, `{ signal?: AbortSignal; timeout?: number }`.
- `signal` cancels the call: the in-flight request, any retry wait (a backoff is cut short, not
  slept through) and every further retry. An already-aborted signal rejects before any request.
- **New error class `GlassnodeAbortError`** (extends `GlassnodeError`, exported): a cancellation
  through `signal`, with the signal's `reason` on `.cause`. Never retried. It is a separate class
  rather than a flag on `GlassnodeNetworkError` so that code retrying network errors never retries
  a deliberate cancellation, and a timeout (`GlassnodeNetworkError`, `timedOut: true`) stays
  distinguishable. A caller abort while the response body is read is also a `GlassnodeAbortError`,
  not a `GlassnodeValidationError`.
- `timeout` overrides the config `timeout` for one call, with the same per-attempt semantics. With
  both `signal` and a timeout, each attempt aborts on whichever fires first. The two signals are
  combined by a small built-in combiner (`AbortSignal.any()` needs Node 20.3+; the package supports
  Node 18) that removes its listeners from the caller's signal after every attempt, so a long-lived
  signal can be reused across many calls without leaking listeners.
- Invalid options reject with a `GlassnodeInputError` before any request: `argument` is `options`
  (not an object), `options.signal` (not an `AbortSignal`) or `options.timeout` (not a positive
  integer up to `2147483647` ms).
- x402: the per-call signal is passed to the x402 fetch in `init`. An abort before any payment was
  sent is a `GlassnodeAbortError`; an abort after the paid request went out stays a
  `GlassnodePaymentError` with `paymentMayHaveSettled: true`, never retried. `src/x402.ts` is
  unchanged.
- **Observable for callers:** none when no `options` are passed — a custom `fetch` sees exactly
  the same calls as before (a single argument by default). JavaScript callers that passed a stray
  extra argument to a method (e.g. `getMetricList(x)`) now get a `GlassnodeInputError` when that
  argument is not an object (or `null`/`undefined`), or has an invalid `signal` or `timeout`. Minor bump: new feature, new error class
  and new exported type (0.x).
- README: "Cancellation and per-call timeouts" section, method signatures, the error table and the
  x402 errors list. The Node 18 smoke script also checks a per-call abort.

## 0.20.0

- **Fixed a money-safety bug.** In x402 mode with `maxRetries` > 0, a `429` or `5xx` answer to the
  **paid** request was retried like any other retryable status. Each retry re-ran the payment flow
  and signed a new payment (fresh nonce). A gateway `502`/`504` sent after the origin had already
  settled, or a server that settles and then errors, could therefore charge one call more than
  once. Once a request carrying a signed payment has been sent, the call is now never retried,
  whatever the HTTP status.
- A non-2xx answer to the paid request, other than `402`, now raises a `GlassnodePaymentError`
  with `paymentMayHaveSettled: true`. This covers `5xx`, `429` and other `4xx` such as `400`: whether
  a payment settles before the handler runs depends on the server and any proxy, which the client
  cannot see. The equivalent `GlassnodeApiError` (`status`, `statusText`, server `detail`, with
  `api_key` values redacted) is on `.cause`.
- **New:** `GlassnodePaymentError.status` holds the HTTP status of the paid response when that
  response caused the failure. It is `undefined` for payment-layer and transport failures.
- Unchanged: a `402` answer to the paid request (the server refused the payment) is still a
  `GlassnodeApiError` with `status` 402, and it is not retried. A `429`/`5xx` or transport failure
  of the unpaid first request is still retried as before: no payment has been signed at that point.
- **Observable for callers:** with x402, a paid request answered with a non-2xx status other than
  `402` used to surface as a `GlassnodeApiError`, and `429`/`5xx` were retried first. It now raises a
  non-retried `GlassnodePaymentError`; the `GlassnodeApiError` is on `.cause`. Code that
  checked `err instanceof GlassnodeApiError && err.status === …` for such responses must check
  `GlassnodePaymentError` (`err.status`) instead. The fetch returned by `createX402Fetch()` now
  rejects in this case instead of resolving with the error response. Non-x402 use is unaffected.
  Minor bump: a new property, and changed error classification in x402 mode (0.x).
- README: the x402 "Errors" section and the error table cover HTTP errors after payment.

## 0.19.0

- **Fixed a money-safety bug.** In x402 mode with `maxRetries` > 0, a transport failure
  (connection reset, or the `timeout` abort) of the **paid** request was retried as a
  `GlassnodeNetworkError`. Each retry signed and sent a new payment with a fresh nonce, so one
  call could be charged more than once. Once a request carrying a signed payment
  (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` / `X-PAYMENT`) has been sent, a failure is now never retried.
- `GlassnodePaymentError` gains `paymentMayHaveSettled` and `timedOut`. A transport failure of the
  paid request now raises a `GlassnodePaymentError` with `paymentMayHaveSettled: true`, the
  original transport error on `.cause`, and `timedOut` set when the `timeout` fired. Check on-chain
  before retrying such a call. Payment failures before anything was sent have
  `paymentMayHaveSettled: false`.
- Transport failures of the unpaid first request (before any payment is signed) are still
  retryable `GlassnodeNetworkError`s.
- **Observable for callers:** with x402, a failed paid request used to be a retried
  `GlassnodeNetworkError`; it is now a non-retried `GlassnodePaymentError`. Non-x402 use is
  unaffected.
- README: the x402 "Errors" section calls out the never-pay-twice behavior and shows how to handle
  `paymentMayHaveSettled`.

## 0.18.0

- **New:** query parameters accept `string | number | boolean | Date` values, not only strings,
  in `callMetric`, `callBulkMetric`, `getMetricMetadata` and `getMetricStats` — e.g.
  `{ a: 'BTC', s: 1609459200 }` or `{ s: new Date('2021-01-01') }` now compile. Values are
  converted before the request: numbers to their shortest round-trip decimal form
  (locale-independent, `-0` → `0`), booleans to `'true'`/`'false'`, a `Date` to unix **seconds**
  floored to the whole second. Strings are sent unchanged, so existing calls produce
  byte-identical URLs.
- **New exported types:** `MetricParams` (the `params` type: typed `a`, `s`, `u`, `i`, `c`, `e`,
  `f` plus an index signature for any other parameter; `api_key` is typed `never`),
  `MetricParamValue`, `MetricTime` (`number | string | Date`) and `MetricInterval`.
- A param whose value is `undefined` is now **omitted** (it used to be sent as the literal
  `undefined`). An `undefined` `api_key`, `f` or `path` counts as absent, so it is no longer
  rejected.
- Values that cannot be sent are rejected with `GlassnodeInputError` (`argument`
  `params.<name>`) before any request: `NaN`, `±Infinity`, integers beyond
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, numbers that would print in exponent notation (e.g. `1e-7`), an
  invalid `Date`, `null`, and objects/arrays/bigints/symbols/functions. `params` that is not an
  object (e.g. a string or an array) is rejected with `argument` `params`.
- **Observable for callers:** typed string callers see no change. Untyped (JavaScript) callers
  that passed `null`, an array (e.g. `['BTC', 'ETH']`, previously sent as `BTC,ETH`) or another
  non-primitive now get a `GlassnodeInputError` instead of a stringified value, and `undefined`
  values are dropped rather than sent. (Corrected in 0.24.0: this entry used to suggest a
  comma-joined string as the replacement for an array, but Glassnode does not treat `a=BTC,ETH` as
  two values; since 0.24.0 pass the array, which is sent as a repeated parameter,
  `a=BTC&a=ETH`.) A literal
  `{ api_key: '…' }` in `params` is now a compile error as well as the existing runtime
  rejection. Minor bump: widened parameter types and new exports.

## 0.17.1

- Fixed stale advice in the HTTP 402 `GlassnodeApiError` message. It told callers to check that
  the price was within `maxPaymentPerCall`, but `createX402Fetch()` now rejects an over-ceiling
  price with `GlassnodePaymentError` before any paid request, so that case never surfaces as a 402. The message now names the two causes a 402 can still have — the fetch is not x402-capable
  (use `createX402Fetch` from `glassnode-api/x402`), or the server refused the payment (e.g.
  insufficient USDC on Base) — and points to `GlassnodePaymentError` for the price ceiling. Only
  the message text changes; `status`, `detail` and retry behavior are unchanged.

## 0.17.0

- **New:** `apiKeyLocation` config option (`'query'` | `'header'`, default `'query'`). With
  `'header'`, the API key is sent as the `X-Api-Key` request header instead of the `api_key` query
  parameter, so it no longer appears in request URLs (custom `fetch`, tracing, proxies, access
  logs, transport errors that quote the URL). A custom `fetch` is then called as
  `fetch(url, { headers: { 'X-Api-Key': key } })`, merged with `signal` when `timeout` is set; no
  header is sent when there is no `apiKey` (e.g. `x402` mode). The fetch from `createX402Fetch()`
  forwards the header.
- `'header'` is opt-in, not the default, because it breaks browsers: the Glassnode API's CORS
  preflight (`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) does not allow `X-Api-Key`.
- Transport error messages now also mask a raw occurrence of the configured key (not only an
  `api_key=` query value).
- Not observable for existing callers: with the default, URLs and the single-argument `fetch` call
  are unchanged. Minor bump: new config option.

## 0.16.0

- **New:** `GlassnodePaymentError` (extends `GlassnodeError`, exported from the package entry).
  The fetch returned by `createX402Fetch()` now rejects with it when the x402 payment layer fails
  before a paid response is obtained — the server's price is above `maxPaymentPerCall` (or x402's
  own spend controls), the signer throws, or the `402` carries no usable payment requirements. The
  message is x402's own (with any `api_key=` value redacted) and x402's error is on `.cause`.
- **Behavior change (observable for callers using x402):** these payment failures used to surface
  as `GlassnodeNetworkError` and were retried when `maxRetries` > 0 (each retry repeating the
  unpaid request and failing again). They are now a `GlassnodePaymentError` and are **never
  retried**. Code catching `GlassnodeNetworkError` for them must catch `GlassnodePaymentError`
  (or the `GlassnodeError` base) instead. Unchanged: a transport failure of the underlying fetch is
  still a retried `GlassnodeNetworkError`, and a `402` returned after payment is still a
  `GlassnodeApiError` (status 402).
- **Behavior change (observable):** `request()` now rethrows any `GlassnodeError` a custom
  `fetch` rejects with unchanged and does not retry it; previously it was wrapped in a
  `GlassnodeNetworkError` (message prefixed `Glassnode API error:`) and retried.
- **Behavior change (observable):** the x402 setup helpers now throw library errors instead of
  plain `Error`: an invalid USDC amount is a `GlassnodeInputError` (`argument: 'maxPaymentPerCall'`
  from `createX402Fetch()`, `'value'` from `usdcDecimalToAtomic()`), and missing optional peer
  dependencies are a `GlassnodeConfigError`. Messages are unchanged and both still extend `Error`.
- Minor bump: new export plus changed error classes (the project is 0.x).

## 0.15.0

- **Behavior change (observable for callers):** `getMetricMetadata()` and `getMetricStats()` now
  apply the same JSON-only `f` rule as `callMetric()`/`callBulkMetric()`. Passing `f` other than
  `json` (case-insensitive; e.g. `{ f: 'csv' }`) rejects with a `GlassnodeInputError`
  (`argument: 'params.f'`) before any request is sent. Previously the request was sent and failed
  later as a `GlassnodeValidationError` or a JSON parse error. An explicit `f: 'json'` is still
  accepted and passed through unchanged. Minor bump: a call that already could not succeed now
  fails earlier and with a different error class.

## 0.14.4

- Documented how timestamps are represented in responses. `MetricMetadata.modified` is the only
  field converted to a `Date`; `MetricMetadata.timerange.min`/`max`, bulk `t` and `callMetric()`
  time-series `t` stay unix seconds as `number`s. Added JSDoc to every time field and a
  "Timestamps" section to the README, including how to convert (`new Date(t * 1000)`).
- Documented and tested that `modified` is `undefined` when the API omits it or sends `0` (`0`
  means "not recorded", not 1970-01-01). No behavior change.

## 0.14.3

- **Fix:** transport failures are classified by the rejection's shape, not `instanceof Error`. A
  `fetch` rejection that is not an `Error` but is named `TimeoutError` (e.g. a DOMException from
  another realm, a polyfill, or a custom `fetch` rejecting with a plain object) is now a
  `GlassnodeNetworkError` with `timedOut: true` and is retried like any other network error;
  one named `AbortError` is retried with `timedOut: false`. Previously both became
  `'Unknown error occurred'` (`timedOut: false`) and were not retried. Other non-`Error`
  rejections (strings, objects without such a `name`) are unchanged: `'Unknown error occurred'`,
  not retried. `Error` rejections keep their message verbatim. The error message now has any
  `api_key=` query value redacted; the original rejection stays on `.cause`.
- CI: the `compat-node18` job now also runs `scripts/smoke-timeout.mjs` (plain Node, no test
  framework) against the built CJS entry, proving a real `AbortSignal.timeout()` abort surfaces as
  `GlassnodeNetworkError` with `timedOut === true` on Node 18. The script is not published.

## 0.14.2

- CI now type-checks the `examples/` scripts against `src/` (`tsconfig.examples.json`, run via
  `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.examples.json`), so an example can no longer silently drift from the
  public API. Examples resolve their dependencies from the root install; no extra install step.
  Tooling only; no package change.

## 0.14.1

- **Deprecated:** `MetricTierSchema` / `MetricTier` and `MetricDataTypeSchema` / `MetricDataType`
  are now marked `@deprecated` and will be removed in the next major release (1.0). No schema or
  client method uses them, and `MetricTier` does not match the API: `MetricMetadata.tier` is a
  number (e.g. `2`), not a `'free' | 'tierN'` string. Use `MetricMetadata['tier']` to type it
  instead. No runtime change.

## 0.14.0

- **Invalid input is rejected before any request is sent.** New exported error class
  `GlassnodeInputError` (extends `GlassnodeError`, with `argument`: `metricPath` or
  `params.<name>`). Methods are `async`, so it arrives as a rejected promise; `fetch` is never
  called. A new class was added because none of the existing ones fit: `GlassnodeConfigError` is
  about constructor options and `GlassnodeValidationError` about server responses (its `endpoint`
  refers to a request that was made).
- **One metric-path policy for `callMetric`, `callBulkMetric`, `getMetricMetadata` and
  `getMetricStats`: validate, never rewrite.** A path must be `/segment[/segment...]` with
  segments of letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `.`. Rejected: non-strings, empty string, a missing
  leading `/` (the message suggests the fixed path), whitespace anywhere, empty segments (`/`,
  `//x`, `/a//b`, trailing `/`), `.`/`..` segments, a query string or `#`, a full URL, and any
  other character (`%`, `\`, ...). Previously `callMetric('market/price_usd_close')` requested
  `/v1/metricsmarket/price_usd_close` and failed later as a confusing 404, and `..` segments could
  reach other endpoints.
- **Parameters the client controls are no longer silently overridden:**
  - `f` in `callMetric` / `callBulkMetric`: anything other than `json` (case-insensitive) is
    rejected; previously e.g. `f: 'csv'` was silently replaced with `json`. `f: 'json'` still
    works.
  - `api_key` in `params` (any method taking `params`): always rejected — set `apiKey` in the
    config. Previously it was silently replaced by the configured key (or, in x402 mode without
    `apiKey`, sent as-is).
  - `path` in `params` of `getMetricMetadata` / `getMetricStats`: rejected. Previously it
    silently overrode the `metricPath` argument.
- **Observable changes for existing callers:** calls with the inputs above, which previously sent
  a request (and usually failed with a `GlassnodeApiError`, or silently used different parameters
  than requested), now reject with `GlassnodeInputError` without a request. Valid calls are
  unchanged: the same URLs are requested. Released as a minor bump under 0.x, consistent with
  previous 0.x releases.
- README: input rules under "Methods" and a `GlassnodeInputError` row in the "Error types" table.

## 0.13.0

- **One error hierarchy for every failure.** All errors thrown by `GlassnodeAPI` now extend a new
  exported base class, `GlassnodeError`, so callers can catch one type and branch on subclasses
  instead of matching message text. New exports: `GlassnodeError`, `GlassnodeNetworkError`,
  `GlassnodeValidationError`, `GlassnodeConfigError`.
  - HTTP error status → `GlassnodeApiError` (now `extends GlassnodeError`). Unchanged otherwise:
    same constructor, `status` / `statusText` / `detail` / `isRetryable`, and message format.
  - Network failure or timeout → `GlassnodeNetworkError` (was a plain `Error`). Same message
    (`Glassnode API error: <msg>`), original error still on `.cause`, plus `timedOut: boolean`:
    `true` when the per-request `timeout` fired (`AbortSignal.timeout()` rejects with a
    `TimeoutError`). A non-`Error` rejection from a custom `fetch` is also a
    `GlassnodeNetworkError` (message `Unknown error occurred`).
  - Response that fails schema validation → `GlassnodeValidationError` (was a raw `ZodError`). The
    `ZodError` is on `.cause`, the failing API path on `.endpoint` (e.g. `/v1/metadata/assets`;
    never includes the query string or API key), and the message names the endpoint and the first
    few issues.
  - `200` body that is not valid JSON → `GlassnodeValidationError` (was a plain `Error`), same
    message, parse error on `.cause`, with `.endpoint`.
  - Invalid constructor config → `GlassnodeConfigError` (was a raw `ZodError`). The `ZodError` is
    on `.cause`; the message lists every invalid field
    (`Invalid GlassnodeAPI config: apiKey: API key is required; ...`).
- Retry behaviour is unchanged: 429/5xx and network errors are retried; validation and JSON-parse
  errors never are.
- **Observable changes for existing callers:** code that did `err instanceof ZodError` (or read
  `err.issues`) for invalid responses or an invalid config must now check
  `GlassnodeValidationError` / `GlassnodeConfigError` and use `err.cause` (the same `ZodError`).
  Code that checked `err.name === 'Error'` or `err.constructor === Error` for network or JSON
  failures now sees the new subclasses (they still extend `Error`; messages are unchanged). The
  config error message text also changed (Zod's JSON-formatted issue list is replaced by the
  summary above). `GlassnodeConfigSchema.parse()` itself still throws `ZodError`. Released as a
  minor bump under 0.x, consistent with previous 0.x releases.
- README: new "Error types" table in the error-handling section.

## 0.12.1

- **CI now actually type-checks the test files.** `tsconfig.test.json` inherited
  `"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "test"]` from `tsconfig.json`, and an inherited `exclude`
  still filters the child's `include`, so `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit` (the "type-check
  test files" step in `ci.yml` / `publish.yml`) only checked `src/` and never saw `test/`. It now
  overrides `exclude` to `["node_modules", "dist"]`; the CJS build (`tsconfig.json`) still
  excludes tests. The check does not read `dist/`, so it keeps running before `pnpm run build`.
- Fixed the latent error this exposed: `test/x402.missing-deps.spec.ts` dynamically imported
  `'../src/x402'` without the `.js` extension required under `NodeNext` (TS2835).
- Tooling/tests only; no change to the published library.

## 0.12.0

- **Response schemas tolerate additive server changes** (rule of thumb: strict enums for inputs,
  lenient for outputs).
  - `ExternalIdsSchema` no longer rejects unknown sources. Previously it was a Zod v4 enum-keyed
    record, which fails on unrecognized keys, so a single asset with a new source (e.g.
    `{ coingecko: 'bitcoin', defillama: '…' }`) made the **whole** `getAssetMetadata()` call throw
    `Unrecognized key`. It is now an object with the known sources as optional string properties
    plus a string catch-all; unknown sources are kept (not stripped). Values must still be strings.
    - **Type-level:** `ExternalIds` changes from `Record<ExternalIdSource, string | undefined>`
      (all three keys required) to optional known keys plus a string index signature:
      `{ ccdata?: string; coinmarketcap?: string; coingecko?: string; [source: string]: string }`.
      Reading `ids.coingecko` is still `string | undefined`; building a value no longer requires
      listing every known source. `ExternalIdSourceSchema` /
      `ExternalIdSource` are kept and now document the _known_ sources, not a closed set.
  - `LagPercentilesSchema` (used by `getMetricStats()`): `p50`/`p90`/`p95`/`p99` are each
    **optional**. If the API omits a percentile for a resolution, the response still parses and
    that field is `undefined`, instead of the whole call throwing. Chosen over dropping the
    resolution or defaulting to a number, which would hide or invent data.
    - **Type-level (source-breaking for some readers):** `LagPercentiles` fields are now
      `number | undefined`. Code using them as `number` (arithmetic, `Math.max`, formatting) must
      handle `undefined` (e.g. `p.p99 ?? 0`). No runtime change for complete responses. Released as
      a minor bump under 0.x; `examples/ex.metric-stats.ts` updated accordingly.

## 0.11.0

- `glassnode-api/x402`'s public types no longer depend on `viem`. `X402FetchOptions.account` is now
  typed as a new structural `X402SignerAccount` interface (`{ address, signTypedData }`) instead of
  viem's `LocalAccount`. A viem account (`privateKeyToAccount(pk)`) is still assignable (verified by
  the type-checked integration test), and consumers on `moduleResolution: node16` with
  `skipLibCheck: false` no longer pull in `viem`'s type chain — clearing `TS1541` and ~12 transitive
  errors from the shipped `.d.ts`.
  - No runtime change. **Type-level note:** the accepted input is wider but the _read_ type is
    narrower — code that extracted `X402FetchOptions['account']` and called viem-specific methods on
    it will no longer compile (fine under 0.x; pass/keep a viem account as before and nothing
    changes).
  - Guarded by a new CI fixture (`typecheck/x402-node16/`) that type-checks a `node16` consumer of
    `glassnode-api/x402` with `skipLibCheck:false` — the leak attw cannot detect.

## 0.10.0

- **Real Node ESM entry.** The `import` condition now resolves to an unbundled ESM build
  (`dist/esm/`, emitted by `tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json`) with `zod` **externalized**, instead of the
  minified browser bundle with `zod` inlined. This fixes `arethetypeswrong`'s
  `node16 (from ESM): Unexpected module syntax` / `Masquerading as CJS`, removes the
  `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning, and lets ESM + CJS consumers share one `zod` instance.
- `exports` now uses per-condition `types` (ESM `.d.ts` under `import`, CJS under `require`), adds a
  `typesVersions` map for the `./x402` subpath under legacy `node10` resolution, and the package
  declares `"type": "commonjs"`. `publint` and `@arethetypeswrong/cli` are now **green across all
  module modes** and enforced as hard CI gates.
- Relative imports in `src/` carry explicit `.js` extensions (required for Node ESM; harmless for
  CJS). No public API change.

## 0.9.12

- Stop shipping browser-bundle source maps (they were ~84% of the tarball). Rollup now emits
  `sourcemap: 'hidden'` (maps still generated locally, but no `sourceMappingURL` comment in the
  published bundle, so no dangling reference) and `.map` is dropped from the `files` allowlist.
  Published tarball shrinks from ~339 KB packed / 1.34 MB unpacked to **~70 KB packed / 0.25 MB
  unpacked** (17 files). Runtime code is unchanged.

## 0.9.11

- CI hardening: enforce coverage thresholds (`test:coverage` replaces `pnpm test` in CI and the
  publish workflow), type-check the test files (`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`), add a
  **Node 18 compat job** that builds and smoke-imports the CJS entry (proving `engines: ">=18"`),
  add `concurrency` cancel-in-progress, and run `publint` + `@arethetypeswrong/cli` as advisory
  packaging audits (they currently flag the bundled ESM entry; they become hard gates once that is
  reworked). No package/runtime change.

## 0.9.10

- Supply chain: the Husky pre-commit hook now runs `pnpm exec lint-staged` (the pinned
  devDependency) instead of `pnpm dlx lint-staged`, which fetched an unpinned latest version from
  the registry on every commit — bypassing both the version pin and the `.npmrc` quarantine.
- Drop the stale `jest.config.mjs` entry from `.npmignore` (the project migrated to Vitest).

## 0.9.9

- Export-map hygiene: list `types` first in each `exports` condition (TypeScript resolves
  conditions in order) and add a `"./package.json"` export so tooling can read the manifest.

## 0.9.8

- Packaging hygiene: `build` now cleans `dist/` first (new `clean` script) so a stale local build
  can never be published, and the `files` allowlist is narrowed to
  `dist/**/*.{js,d.ts,js.map}`. Verified: `npm pack` ships 19 files (~339 KB packed) with no stale
  bundles. (Note: CI already built from a clean checkout, so released tarballs were never affected;
  this closes the gap for a local `npm publish`.)

## 0.9.7

- Harden retries: cap each wait at the new `maxRetryDelay` config (default 30s), apply **full
  jitter** to avoid synchronised retries across clients, and honour a `Retry-After` header on
  `429` for the next wait.
- A malformed `200` response body is **no longer retried** — JSON parsing now happens outside the
  retry scope and fails immediately (previously a bad body was retried as if it were a network
  error). Replace the `throw lastError` tail with a definitive throw.

## 0.9.6

- Add a `timeout` config option (ms). When set, each request attempt is aborted via
  `AbortSignal.timeout()` (a fresh signal per retry), so a stalled connection no longer hangs
  indefinitely. Unset by default; the no-timeout path still calls a custom `fetch` with the URL
  only, preserving existing behavior.

## 0.9.5

- Add `examples/ex.metric-stats.ts`: a console example for `getMetricStats()` that fetches the
  data-lag percentiles for BTC/SOL active addresses and BTC/SOL OHLC price, and renders a colored
  in-terminal visualization (two-tone p50▸p99 bars, scaled per metric). Docs in `examples/README.md`.

## 0.9.3

- CI/infra fix: the new `.npmrc` `ignore-scripts=true` broke the `pnpm/action-setup` bootstrap
  in CI and publish workflows — the standalone `@pnpm/exe` needs its `preinstall` to select the
  platform binary. Re-enable scripts (`npm_config_ignore_scripts=false`) for that bootstrap step
  only; project installs still run with `ignore-scripts=true`. No package/runtime change.

## 0.9.2

- **Security (dev-only):** resolve the 4 open Dependabot alerts (all medium, development scope).
  The `vitest`/`@vitest/mocker` path-traversal advisory (< 4.1.11) is cleared by the move to
  vitest 5.0.0. Add `pnpm.overrides` for the two remaining transitive deps: `postcss` `>=8.5.23`
  (resolves to 8.5.28 — sourceMappingURL arbitrary `.map` read) and `@humanfs/node` `>=0.16.8`
  (resolves to 0.17.0 — recursive copy follows symlinks). No runtime/consumer impact.

## 0.9.1

- Dependency maintenance: bump dev and runtime deps to their latest versions allowed by the
  repo's `.npmrc` supply-chain policy (`minimum-release-age`, 7 days): `zod` 4.6.5,
  `typescript-eslint` 8.70.0, `eslint` 10.10.0, `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` 5.0.0,
  `rollup` 4.63.2, `viem` 2.56.5, `@x402/{fetch,evm}` 2.25.0, `lint-staged` 17.5.1,
  `prettier` 3.9.6. `typescript` stays on 6.x (`typescript-eslint`'s peer still caps at
  `<6.1.0`).
- Pin `@types/node` to the **Node 18 floor** (`^18`) rather than the latest, so the compiler
  enforces the package's `>=18` runtime support instead of merely tracking the dev runtime.
- Docs: clarify in `CLAUDE.md` that the library targets Node **>=18** for consumers while the
  dev environment runs Node **24** (vitest 5 requires dev Node >=22.12); refresh the
  TypeScript-6.x pin rationale.

## 0.9.0

- Add `getMetricStats(path, params?)` for the `/v1/metadata/metric/stats` endpoint: returns a
  metric's current data lag as aggregated percentiles (`p50`/`p90`/`p95`/`p99`) per resolution over
  the trailing 30 days. Optional `a` param scopes stats to a single asset. New exported types:
  `MetricStatsResponse`, `MetricLagEntry`, `LagPercentiles` (and their Zod schemas).

## 0.8.3

- Add a checked-in `.npmrc` with supply-chain hardening defaults: `ignore-scripts=true` (block
  install-time lifecycle scripts) and `minimum-release-age=10080` (require dependencies to be at
  least 7 days old before install). Repo-config only; not published in the package tarball.

## 0.8.0

- Add opt-in, Node-first **x402 payment support**: `x402: true` config preset (routes to
  `https://x402.glassnode.com`) and a new `glassnode-api/x402` subpath export with
  `createX402Fetch({ account, maxPaymentPerCall })`. The crypto stack (`@x402/fetch`, `@x402/evm`,
  `viem`) is an optional peer dependency; the core package stays `zod`-only.
- `apiKey` is now optional when `x402` is enabled; `fetch` is required in that mode.
- Add a friendly `402` error message. Bulk metrics remain free-API only (unsupported over x402).
- `GlassnodeApiError` now surfaces the server's error-body message (e.g. "Resolution 1h is not
  allowed") and exposes it on `.detail`, instead of only a generic status message.
- **Security:** redact the `api_key` query-param value in URLs passed to the optional `logger`
  (previously the key could leak into log sinks).

## 0.7.7

- Fix transitive dev-dependency vulnerabilities via `pnpm.overrides`: `flatted` ≥3.4.2 (high), `serialize-javascript` ≥7.0.5, `picomatch` ≥4.0.4, `brace-expansion` ≥5.0.6 — `pnpm audit` now clean
- README: lead with the Node.js/console usage; move browser (UMD/ESM) usage into its own section
- Replace the broken Bundlephobia size badge with a bundlejs min+gzip bundle-size badge

## 0.7.6

- Migrate test runner from Jest to Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`, `test:watch`/`test:coverage` scripts); remove `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`
- Upgrade dependencies: `zod` 4.4.3, `typescript` 6.0.3, `eslint` 10.7.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.64.0, `prettier` 3.9.5, `rollup` 4.62.2, `@types/node` 26.1.1, `lint-staged` 17.0.8, `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` 29.0.3
- Publish via npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with provenance instead of an `NPM_TOKEN` secret; align CI/publish workflows with standalone pnpm
- Add package metadata: `homepage`, `bugs`, `engines`, `sideEffects`, `exports`, `publishConfig`, `keywords`, and expanded `author`
- Rewrite README for discoverability (badges, features, and complete API / configuration / error-handling / retry / bulk docs); add MIT `LICENSE` file
- Add `packageManager` field so the standalone pnpm setup in CI/publish workflows resolves the pnpm version

## 0.7.0

- Fix `callBulkMetric()` URL from `/v1/bulk/...` to `/v1/metrics/.../bulk`
- Fix bulk response envelope unwrapping (`{ data }`)
- Add `is_pit`, `bulk_supported`, `timerange`, and `refs.metric_variant` fields to `MetricMetadata`
